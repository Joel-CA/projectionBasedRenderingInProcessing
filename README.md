# Projection-Based Rendering In Processing
Rederiving and implementing projection-based rendering in Processing
Implemented optimizations include:
<ul>
  <li>Backface Culling</li>
  <video src="clips/frustum+backfaced_fishScene.mp4" width="320" height="240" controls></video>
  <li>Frustum Culling</li>
  <li>Third item</li>
  <li>Fourth item</li>
</ul>

My derivation notes can be found [here](Projection-Based Rendering Notebook.pdf), though they are a bit chaotic. Future work may include formalizing this written theory in Overleaf as an exercise.
